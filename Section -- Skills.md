# System

The skills system has changed from throughout the series, Morrowind/Oblivion and Skyrim has separate skilling systems.

# Skills

A skill is a scalar of how much you have done a certain set of actions. The higher you are on the scale, the more perks/advantages you get.

## Combat skills

Combat skills are skills that increases when doing a set of combat actions. E.g. using a lot of spells will increase a certain magic skill.

TODO: Decide what kind of skill should be included in TES VI. Should there be 5 different magic skills or should some of them be combined?

## Non-combat skills

### Enchanting

Enchanting should not done by just clicking, it's not immersive or fun at all. Enchanting needs to be a *fun* grind, kind of like a mini game that's not gimmicky.

### Crafting

Crafting should not done by just clicking, it's not immersive or fun at all.
