# Philosophy

As everyone desires different experiences from the Elder Scrolls, some basic principles needs to be set of what the next TES game should be like. Conflicting basic principles will stagger development of the specification and will thus exists for now.

The language used in this specification does not have to be the most advanced. Rather, just try to be exceptionally clear and concise.

Note: Skip if you want to read the ideas for TES VI

TODO: Add new basic principles, or remove some

## Micro ideas, Macro ideas

As this specification is only about ideas, introducing some categories makes it easier to reason about when discussing.

**Micro ideas** are ideas which are aimed to solve more targeted and more specific problems. It's also ideas like how to make a small piece of the UI better, e.g. "Show stats when hover on item".

**Macro ideas** are ideas which are aimed to solve a fundamental problem with the game, or lay down the basis of the game's mechanics. E.g. "There should be attributes in TES VI because ..."

This specification encourages focus on **Macro ideas** and not that much on **Micro ones**. This is because Micro ones could most of the time be implemented with third-party mods, which then gives Bethesda more time to work on more game changing issues. E.g. perfecting window placements in a castle will not drastically change the game the same way Skills will.

We believe also believe that TES VI needs a solid basis which the modding community can build upon. Skyrim had many flawed game designs/mechanics which even mods didn't even solve, we want to avoid that in TES VI. A flawed basis is also hard to build on.

Note: Micro ideas are still welcome!

## Explore new ideas

The Elder Scrolls series should not be obliged to follow it's history. The series should be more flexible to explore new interesting ideas if it so wants to. Avoid new ideas for the sake of new ideas.

## Immersion

The Elder Scrolls series should develop with immersion in mind at all times. Thus, ideas should also revolve around immersion.

Note: Immersion is subjective but it's possible that many like TES because of how immersive it is; purely speculation.

## Suitable ideas

The ideas in this specification should be reasonable to implement. Think rationally about the idea and decide if it suitable for TES VI. The idea might be better off as a mod rather than having Bethesda implementing it.
