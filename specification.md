Project Greenheart (Elder Scrolls VI) Specification
---------------------------------------------------

**Introduction**

This is an unofficial specification of Elder Scrolls VI, which will called for now Project Greenheart. The name Project Greenheart comes from the Bethesda letter which was spread around the internet a couple of years ago. The letters legitimacy is still unconfirmed but is now believed to be real due to the "Fallout 4: Nuka-World" prediction.
