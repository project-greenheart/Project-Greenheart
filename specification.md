Project Greenheart (Elder Scrolls VI) Specification
---------------------------------------------------

**Introduction**

This is unofficial Specification for Elder Scrolls VI,
which is called under the code name Project Greenheart.
The code name Project Greenheart comes from the Bethesda letter which was spread
around the internet. The letters legitimacy is still unconfirmed but is
now believed to be real due to the Fallout: Nuka-World prediction.

Disclaimer:
Right now in early stages and I do not have a lot of knowledge about the Elder Scrolls series as a whole. Have only played Skyrim.

Please contribute with your ideas!
Use *issues* to spark a discussion and *pull requests* to contribute with changes to
the specification.
