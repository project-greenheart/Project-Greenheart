# Philosophy

As every desires different experiences from the Elder Scrolls,
some basic principles needs to be set.

**Explore new ideas**
The Elder Scrolls series should not be obliged to follow it's history.
The series should be more free to explore new interesting ideas.

**Immersion**
The Elder Scrolls series should be about immersion and role-playing.

**Story telling**
As immersion and role-playing is important, so is story telling.
It should be a believable and interesting story to *play*.
