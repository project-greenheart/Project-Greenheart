# Philosophy

As everyone desires different experiences from the Elder Scrolls, some basic principles needs to be set of what the next TES game should be like. Conflicting basic ideas will stagger development of the specification and will exists for now.

TODO: Philosophy section might be removed as it might be limiting the ideas.

**Explore new ideas**

The Elder Scrolls series should not be obliged to follow it's history. The series should be more flexible to explore new interesting ideas.

**Immersion**

The Elder Scrolls series should be about immersion and role-playing.

**Story telling**

As immersion and role-playing is important, so is story telling. It should be a believable and interesting story to *play*.
