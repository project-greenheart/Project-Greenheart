# VR

Virtual Reality (VR) has become more widely adopted in the recent years. The amount of developers and consumer has increased but it's still only available as a luxury item. A good solution for movement in-game has yet to created. So the big question is: Should TES VI adopt VR? If yes, how much?

## Immersion

VR's immersion is the best type of immersion you can get today. TES VI must have VR on launch for a couple of reasons. VR shines the most with the immersive games, which makes TES VI one of the perfect games for it.

## VR-first

TES VI should not be VR-first. It's probably not a profitable move for Bethesda and not everyone can afford VR yet. Bethesda's profit do matter to us and them.
