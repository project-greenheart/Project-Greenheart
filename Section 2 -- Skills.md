# Skills/leveling/attributes system

The skills system has changed from throughout the series, Morrowind/Oblivion and Skyrim has separate skilling systems.

## Attributes

Attributes in ES VI should be implemented. It should be similar to how Diablo II's attribute system. You get *attribute points* on leveling and you assign it to the attributes. Attribute points are locked in, in other words not revertable.

It should be like this because it encourages players to be more strategic, but could also annoy the player when points are assigned wrong in hindsight.
