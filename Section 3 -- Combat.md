# Combat

Combat is about the ways to fight enemies.

## Magic

Magic in Skyrim is boring and uncreative. The Destruction spells are all based around damage and do not involve a lot of strategic play. Stronger spells only do more damage.

The spells in ES VI should be creative, fun and have a learning curve.
Overwatch is a great example for these type of spells. [Junkrat](https://youtu.be/mFGQG8I68h8), which is heavily inspired by Team Fortress 2's Demoman is very fun to play and has a learning curve. His ability [*Frag Launcher*](https://youtu.be/SdGx4KK-Nrk) is a very good example. Another example is Anivia's [*Crystallize*](https://youtu.be/IlAUStvGa1I) (from League of Legends) and Mei's [*Ice Wall*](https://youtu.be/FOSBWjqa-vk?t=5s) (from Overwatch) which is kind of the same spell.

The Skyrim mod community have created many interesting spells while some are more buggy than others. But nonetheless they are more interesting and above all, more fun to play with.

## Archery

Archery in Skyrim felt too monotonous. It was basically point and release and the animation was slow and irritating. Hanzo from Overwatch has some great abilities and is a great source for inspiration. It's also what archery can become in ES VI. Check out Hanzo's [*Scatter Arrow*](https://youtu.be/dgh28b8UuSE).

## Melee

Melee in Skyrim was basically just hack and slash in a very monotonous way. There's not much strategic play. Here the ES series could get some inspiration from Dark Souls.
