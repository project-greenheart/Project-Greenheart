# Attributes

Attributes should be implemented in TES VI. It should be similar to how Diablo II's attribute system works. You get *attribute points* on leveling and you assign it to the attributes. Attribute points are locked in, in other words not revertable. Attributes could be like Str, Int, Dex, Agi, etc. and applying points to each attribute has some effect on a skill. E.g. Increasing Str increases Melee damage, while increasing Agi increases Archery damage and movement speed.

It should be like this because it encourages players to be more strategic, but could also annoy the player when points are assigned wrong in hindsight.
