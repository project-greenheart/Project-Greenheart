# VR

Virtual Reality (VR) has become more widely adopted in the recent years.
The amount of developers and consumer has increased but it's still only
available as a luxury item. A good solution for movement in-game has yet to created.
So the big question is: Should ES VI adopt VR? If yes, how much?

## Immersion

VR's immersion is the best type of immersion you can get today. ES VI must have
VR on launch for a couple of reasons. VR shines the most with the immersive games,
which makes ES VI one of the perfect games for it.

## VR-first

ES VI should not be VR-first. It might not be a profitable move and not everyone
can afford VR yet.
